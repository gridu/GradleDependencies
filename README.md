# GradleDependencies

This module is focused on Gradle dependencies management, which is an essential part of software development. In Gradle,
dependencies refer to external libraries and frameworks that a project requires to function correctly.

Managing dependencies can be a complicated task as it involves ensuring that all dependencies are compatible with each
other and with the project's codebase. Gradle provides a robust and flexible system for managing dependencies that makes
it easier to manage complex projects.

In this module, you will learn how to declare dependencies in your Gradle project, manage different versions of the same
dependency, exclude transitive dependencies, and manage dependencies for different build variants. You will also learn
how to use Gradle's dependency cache and how to publish your own dependencies to a remote repository.

By the end of this module, you should have a solid understanding of how to manage dependencies in a Gradle project and
be able to apply this knowledge to your own projects effectively.

    * [Working with Dependencies: Learning the basics](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/core_dependency_management.html)

### Description of project modules

The project consist all required modules for the task. You need to compile them and publish to Your local repository (_
publishToMavenLocal_ command).

![Components](docs/components.png)

The project has a runnable module [ _ClientApp_](../main/ClientApp).<br/>
Which has 2 dependencies on: [_ScienceLibrary_](../main/ScienceLibrary) and [_SoftwareLibrary_](../main/SoftwareLibrary)
.<br/>
Both libraries have dependencies on the _Book_ module, but on different versions.<br/>
_ScienceLibrary_ depends on [_booktransitive:0.1_](../main/BookTransitiveV1), _SoftwareLibrary_ on - [_booktransitive:
0.2_](../main/BookTransitiveV2).<br>

Resolve dependencies by changing the [../ClientApp/build.gradle](../main/ClientApp/build.gradle) file. Use
Gradle [dependency management](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/core_dependency_management.html) for it.

## Tasks

### Task 1 - preparation

* [Install & configure](#Installation) projects
* Run the command bellow, check results:

```sh
% gradle clean build run

> Task :run

 ...
    |  /                                           /.
    \_/___________________________________________/.

Action 1: I take from the 'Science Library'   a book 'Programming in Scala Fifth Edition 5st edition.' by Martin Odersky (v2)
Action 2: I take from the 'Software Library'  a book 'Programming in Scala Fifth Edition 5st edition.' by Martin Odersky (v2)

The application is over...

```

* Print dependencies tree, and explain it.

### Task 2 - dependency management

Change resolved _Book_ dependencies for this task. The result should be:

```sh
% gradle clean build run

> Task :run

 ...
    |  /                                           /.
    \_/___________________________________________/.

Action 1: I take from the 'Science Library'   a book 'Machine Learning Yearning'. by Andrew Ng. (v1)
Action 2: I take from the 'Software Library'  a book 'Machine Learning Yearning'. by Andrew Ng. (v1)


The application is over...

```

Do it by changing the [build.gradle](../main/ClientApp/build.gradle) file. Provide several way to do that:

* Declaring simple version declaration
* Declaring rich versions
* Exclude unnecessary dependency
* Use resolution strategy
* Use Locking dependency versions

Explain what each method does. Show pros/contra of each of them.

### Task 3 - optional

* Add code for failing on versions conflict.
* Add code for failing on specific _Book_ version.
* Implement _Book_ resolving in the case of the presence of an environment variable. Do it in
  the [build.gradle](../main/ClientApp/build.gradle)
* Add slf4-logging to all sub-modules. Describe what dependencies in what module should be used.
* Find/use Gradle plugins for dependencies management (
  e.g. [here](https://plugins.gradle.org/search?term=dependencies+conflicts))

## Installation

You should have:
* JVM version >= 9
* Scala version >= 13 
* Gradle version >= 7
(The other version maybe working as well)
